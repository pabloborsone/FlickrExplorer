There are still a lot of stuff to do, here are a few:
- Add more unit tests for the existing layers;
- Add UI tests;
- Handle errors properly with UI feedback ideally;
- Handle iOS native error on AsyncImage or replace the component with another one;
- Add localization support;
- Move URLSession from the service layer to an abstraction and inject the abstract instead;
- And more...
